**Active Directory is a directory service developed by Microsoft for Windows domain networks. It stores information about network objects such as computers, users, and groups. It provides authentication and authorisation services, and allows administrators to manage network resources centrally.**

**Domain Controller :** The server that runs the Active Directory services is known as a Domain Controller (DC).A domain controller is a server that manages security authentication requests in a Windows Server network. It stores user account information and controls access to resources on the network. It is a critical component for managing and securing a network infrastructure.

##  Advantage

The main advantages of having a configured Windows domain are:

**Centralised identity management:**  All users across the network can be configured from Active Directory with minimum effort.

**Managing security policies:**  You can configure security policies directly from Active Directory and apply them to users and computers across the network as needed.
